    From Fall 2013 to Spring 2015, I worked as a print designer and then art director for <em>Bluestockings</em> magazine, and anti-oppressive pulication based in Providence, RI. As a print designer, I worked with my fellow designers, editors, and writers to create two 100-page print issues, which can be seen below. After a year as a print designer, my colleagues elected me to be the art director of the magazine. This meant coordinating a staff of 10 illustrators with far more craft and creativity than myself to create at least 3 illustrations weekly for our online articles, solicit art submissions from Providence artists, and leading the development of that year's print issue.
