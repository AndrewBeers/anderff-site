    Machine learning algorithms (usually) need human-generated ground-truth in order to operate effectively. If you are training a machine learning algorithm to tell the difference between images of cats and dogs, then at some point you will need likely need a human being to sit down and classify a series of images as being of "cats" or "dogs". For most tasks, it is relatively easy to pay annotators to quickly mark-up thousands of images in this fashion, but this is not the case in radiology. Classifying disease in an MRI or CT scan requires expert knowledge in the field, and can only reliably be done by trained radiologists. These radiologists have little incentive to spend their days annotating thousands of images for little compensation, and in any case tools are limited for them to do so. <br />
    <br />
    To address these concerns, I was part of a multi-institution team that created CrowdQuant, a web app that lets trained radiologist quickly identify tumors and draw lines of maximum diameters on publically available data on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Radiologists' annotations submitted via CrowdQuant will later be uploaded as a supplement to TCIA datasets. I just led an exhibit test-running CrowdQuant at RSNA 2017, and it was a resounding success. Trained radiologists provided over 2000 annotations on 450 liver, lung, renal, and ovarian cancer CT scans. In the coming months, these annotations can be used by researchers developing tumor localization algorithms <br />
    <br >
    We intend to continue improving CrowdQuant, and bring the presentation "on the road" to other radiologists conferences in the following year. See a version of the app that you can use here: <a href="http://rsnacrowdquant2.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com/">link</a>. [Update: Sorry! We've taken the data offline for now.]
