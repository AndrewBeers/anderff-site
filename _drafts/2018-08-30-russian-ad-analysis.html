<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
<br />
On May 10, 2018, Democrats on the United States House Intelligence Committee <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/social-media-advertisements.htm">released</a> 3500+ Facebook and Instagram ads created by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) between 2015 and 2017. The IRA is believed to have created these ads to influence the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election, and in general influence Americans' political views. 
<br /><br />
I first read articles about this dataset the day after it came out, and I was intrigued. It was straight-forwardly interesting. To me, the ads posted on sites like <a href="">Wired</a> and the <a href="">Washington Post</a> were a look into how non-Americans perceived America. The ads featured in these news reports were direct appeals to wildly different sectors of the American populace -- conservative, liberal, LGBTQ, gun-owners -- and had a bluntness in their messaging that other American political ads I saw lacked.
<br/><br />
Accordingly, I initially thought of the ad release as a great sociological dataset &mdash; published results from an unethical experiment designed to maximize American advertising response. It helped to answer questions like "what ideas, in our present political enviroment, drives different groups of Americans to share ideas with their peers". However, as I shared the dataset with others, I realized that there was a separate, and probably more obvious use that many saw in this dataset. A commenter on my <a href="">reddit post</a> on the ad data summed it up well:
<blockquote>
Idk what your political leaning is but if the US truly is compromised it is up to the people to coordinate a defense. This data is an analysis of Russia's attack on Western Democracy and you are doing the work of a patriot, whether you are American or not, regardless of your political background. Thank you, sincerely.

</blockquote>
<br />
To this commenter and many others, the IRA ad release was less a sociological dataset and more of a criminological post-mortem of the 2016 election. Many people saw that election as an <a href="">unexpected catastrophe</a>, and that events like the Russian social media influence campaign could help to illuminate how so many political forecasters could end up being so terrifyingly wrong. 
<br /><br />
I initially resisted this viewpoint on the ad release. I am not qualified to say what exactly got Trump elected, but I side with others who say that his election was a predictable response to an increasingly-coordinated movement of rich Americans to cynically exploit other Americans' pre-existing racist beliefs during a black presidency which had already inflamed them. However, other people thought so, and as the issue is investigated more it seems like <a href="">they might have been right</a>". So, I'll raise a second question that could be answered with this dataset: "Does this dataset show that Russian Facebook and Instagram posts affected voter choices in the 2016 election, or voter beliefs on other important political issues?"
<br/ ><br />
Both questions are intertwined, and each could probably take up a whole PhD thesis. Incidentally, through sharing this dataset on Twitter I've learned a few people who are doing just such work. But, just because I've spent so much time with this data, I figured I would write up some reflections that might help to answer a small part of one or the other of those questions. They are presented in bullet-point format below.

<h2>Not Just Conservatives</h2>
When news first hit of Russians using Facebook and Instagram ads to politically influence Americans, many <a href="">assumed</a> that they would be targeting the stereotypical conservative voter: an older internet novice that is easily swept up by conspiratorial thinking. Even when evidence of IRA ads clearly appealing to black voters were published, at least some assumed that these ads must have been shown to conservative white voters, in order to make them feel reactionary anger towards the concerns of black voters.
<br /><br />
Both of these viewpoints are incorrect in the IRA data release. Only X% of the ads appealed towards viewers with conservative interests, and those ads only comprised X% of the total views and Y% of the total clicks in the IRA dataset. And as far as I can tell, there were no ads highlighting black empowerment aimed towards conservative voters. The IRA targeted all sides of the political spectrum, and indeed some of the most creative ads come from campaigns aimed towards black people and queer people [<a href=""><a href="">].
<br /><br />


<h2>The Data We Don't Have</h2>
<br /><br />
If we accept that one of the IRA's main goals was to elect Trump, then what were the aims of these ads appealing to progressive groups. Some think that these ads were created to increase polarization in American politics by creating echo chambers and otherwise decreasing empathy for the other "side" -- I cover my own view on this idea in the next section. 

<h2>"Divisive" Ads, or Ads I Actually Liked</h2>
<a href="">Some</a> believe that Americans are using increasingly polarized, "divisive" political language, and that losing the ability to compromise with one another over political issues has led to our present political climate.
<br /><br />
The IRA dataset, and the fact that they aimed their ads towards progressives and conservatives alike, plays directly into these beliefs about the destructive potential of divisiveness in political speech. As the theory goes, the IRA creates ads that appeal to both conservatives and progressives on issues that matter to them, deepening the divide between them. The IRA does this because they want to undermine democracy in the US by making us unable to pubicly debate ideas.
<br /><br />
How effective the IRA's strategy to polarize Americans via political advertisements is the stuff of double-blind studies (<a href="">here's some that have tried</a>).
<br /><br />
Many ads released by the IRA contained unusual phrases that indicated a non-fluent English writer (<a href=""></a>), or were so ham-handed in there ideas as to be obvious (<a href="">hopefully</a>) fakes. Others, though, were written in convincing English.

<h2>Memes &mdash; Not Even Political Memes, Just Memes</h2>
Most people who spend some time with the Russian Ad Explorer soon stumble upon the IRA's meme posts. Most have almost no political content (a few exceptions: <a href=""><a href="">), and some are actually kind of funny (sue me <a href=""><a href="">). Many people who used the explorer assumed that these memes were honey-traps for pro-Trump pages &mdash; that, at some point down the line, Memeopolis would start shilling for Trump.
<br /><br />
As I described in the "Data We Don't Have" section, this claim is difficult to immediately verify with this dataset. For example, Memeopolis, the IRA's main meme-sharing page, never released a directly pro-Trump advertisement despite the success of its meme advertisements. If it was re-directing users to pro-Trump pages or viewpoints, it did so via non-advertised posts on the Memeopolis page itself, or otherwise through Facebook comments or other user behaviors. Congress says it will release such data <a href="">at some point</a>, so until then it is hard to know what to make of Memeopolis.

<h2>Not Just Americans</h2>
This a relatively minor point, but some ads released in this dataset were not aimed at Americans at all. Specifically, some of the anti-immigration ads [<a href=""></a>, <a href=""></a>, <a href=""></a>] were double-shared towards other European countries, probably because of these countries' shared sickness of despising immigrants. 
<br /><br />
It is not clear to me from information in the initial release if this ad dataset was supposed to comprise the sum-total efforts of the IRA, or just the American portion. Regardless, it is worth noting regardless that the purpose of the IRA was not only to influence American voters, but also in rare cases people in other countries too.

<h2>Post-Election Goals of the IRA</h2>
The IRA continued to function after the election of Trump, which many presumed was their primary goal. So what goals did they chase afterwards? Here's a quick run-down of some of the broad ad categories they posted:
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h2>Vote for Bernie, or Jill Stein</h2>
I have assumed that the IRA worked to get Trump elected, but they also worked at times to get Bernie the primary nomination over Hillary, and in rare instances even suggested voting for Jill Stein.
