      <h1>The Russian Ad Explorer</h1><br />
      On May XX, 2018, Democrats in the congressional [...] released 3500+ ads created by the Internet Research Agency between 2015 and 2017. The Internet Research Agency is believed to have created ads to influence the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election, and in general influence the American public's political views. Many articles have been published analzying the content of the data -- you can see some other examples and visualizations here: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/05/11/what-we-found-facebook-ads-russians-accused-election-meddling/602319002/">USA Today</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/14/technology/facebook-ads-congress.html">NYTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/10/here-are-the-3400-facebook-ads-purchased-by-russias-online-trolls-during-the-2016-election/?utm_term=.bcf68aad1b78">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/house-democrats-release-3500-russia-linked-facebook-ads/">Wired</a>. For my part, I have been surprised by how many of the ads targeted not only white, conservative users, but also self-identified progressive, Black, Latinx, Native America, and queers users. 

      <br /><br />
      This website was created from PDF files released by congress at this link: <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/social-media-advertisements.htm">house.gov</a>. Images and and text from the Russian Ad Explorer were scraped automatically from these files, and as such contain typographical errors or missing images. Until this dataset is checked over manually, any ad text or statistics should be verified by downloading the original PDF file using the "Download" button. A Github repository will soon be made available that details the exact tools and transformations applied to these source PDFs.

      <br /><br />
      If you have any requests or questions regarding this data, send a message to <a href="mailto:russian.ad.explorer@gmail.com">russian.ad.explorer@gmail.com</a>. You can download a JSON file that I have generated from this data here: . A third dataset of images and text extracted from each PDF will be released soon.
