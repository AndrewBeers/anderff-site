<div class="bioblock">Hi!<br /><br />I'm Andrew Beers. I'm a graduate of Brown University living in Boston and working at the <a href="https://www.martinos.org/lab/qtim">Quantitative Tumor Imaging Lab</a> at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. I'm interested in loads of things, but most of them revolve around writing, feminism, basketball, icebergs, and huge-messed-up-very-bad datasets. My work at the QTIM particularly focuses on machine learning as applied to medical imaging scans, as well as development for the imaging program <a href="https://www.slicer.org/">3D Slicer.</a> <br /><br />
