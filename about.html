<div class="bioblock">Hi!<br /><br />I'm Andrew Beers. I am a PhD student in the University of Washington's Human-Centered Design and Engineering program (HCDE), working at the <a href="https://www.cip.uw.edu/">Center for an Informed Public</a>. I research mis/disinformation on social media, and am advised by Kate Starbird and Emma Spiro. More specifically, I focus on understanding the most popular influencers who produce a disproportionate amount of mis- and disinformation in the United States.
<br /><br />

Before my PhD, I worked at the <a href="https://www.martinos.org/lab/qtim">Quantitative Translational Imaging Lab</a> at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. My work at the QTIM focused on machine learning as applied to medical imaging scans, as well as software development for the imaging program <a href="https://www.slicer.org/">3D Slicer</a> and the Python package <a href="https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/DeepNeuro">DeepNeuro</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Brown University in the Environmental Studies department researching historical records of climate change in the North Atlantic ocean. In between, I have worked for non-profit organizations in research and fundraising capacities.<br /><br />
