<div class="bioblock">Hi!<br /><br />I'm Andrew Beers. As of fall 2019, I am a PhD student in the University of Washington's Human-Centered Design and Engineering program (HCDE). I research mis/disinformation and polarization on social media.
<br /><br />

Until the summer of 2019, I worked at the <a href="https://www.martinos.org/lab/qtim">Quantitative Translational Imaging Lab</a> at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. My work at the QTIM focused on machine learning as applied to medical imaging scans, as well as software development for the imaging program <a href="https://www.slicer.org/">3D Slicer</a> and the Python package <a href="https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/DeepNeuro">DeepNeuro</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Brown University in the Environmental Studies department researching historical records of climate change in the North Atlantic ocean. In between, I have worked for non-profit organizations in research and fundraising capacities.<br /><br />

You can see a list of publications on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kPQgDcsAAAAJ">Google Scholar profile</a>, my CV at this <a href="http://anderff.com/resources/ABeers_CV.pdf">link</a>, and some of my coding projects on <a href="https://github.com/AndrewBeers">my Github account</a>.<br /><br />
